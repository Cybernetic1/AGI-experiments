# Progress Update: Breakthrough with Davidsonian Parsing

**Date:** 2026-01-02  
**Major Achievement:** Hybrid symbolic-neural architecture with rule injection mechanism implemented!

## 🎯 Key Results

### Latest (2026-01-02): Davidsonian Parsing
```
Davidsonian extraction: 80%+ coverage on common NL patterns ✓
Symbolic KB + forward chaining: Working ✓
Integration with differentiable logic: In progress 🔄
```

**Innovation:** Rule injection - read text about reasoning → immediately apply knowledge

### Previous (2026-01-01): GA Validation
```
Neural Network (50 rules, 30 epochs):  0.00% accuracy ✗
Genetic Algorithm (30 generations):    61.6% fitness  ✓
TicTacToe GA (1 generation):           46.5% win rate ✓
```

**GA discovered interpretable rule:** `['NOUN', 'VERB']` pattern that matches all test examples!

## Why This Matters

### Davidsonian Approach (Current)
1. **Competitive advantage over LLMs:** Rule injection vs implicit weight learning
2. **Data efficiency:** Read once, apply forever (vs massive training data)
3. **Compositionality:** Events as first-class entities (unlimited modification)
4. **Interpretability:** Rules are inspectable and modifiable

### GA Validation (Foundation)
1. **Validates symbolic search:** Discrete optimization works for symbolic rules
2. **Sample efficient:** Found working rule with 7,500 evaluations (vs 30,000 for neural)
3. **Interpretable:** Can see exactly what pattern was learned
4. **Uses semantic-AR:** Fitness based on meaning preservation, not surface form

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. ✅ Implement Davidsonian extraction
2. ✅ Create knowledge base with forward chaining
3. 🔄 Integrate with differentiable logic network
4. 🔄 Test on semantic-AR with TinyStories

### Near-term (Weeks 2-3)
1. Implement reflection mechanism (logic form → rules)
2. Add rule generalization (variable introduction)
3. Measure convergence improvement vs baseline
4. Test "read linguistics textbook → parse better" capability
