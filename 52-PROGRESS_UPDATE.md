```
DLN + Symbolic logic engine: Working ✓
Memory consolidation through neural learning: ✓
Rule extraction and reflection: ✓
Davidsonian parsing integrated: ✓
```

**New architectural focus (2026-01-04, afternoon):** DLN will own AR and memory consolidation with distributed representations. The symbolic logic engine co-exists as the structural interpreter and reflection layer. If the symbolic side also tries to do AR/generalization, it becomes redundant—so we constrain it to logic structuring, inference, and reflection while DLN handles distributional consolidation.

**Major Innovation:** Solved the memory consolidation problem! DLN learns compressed rules (like LLMs learn weights) but outputs symbolic logical forms that enable reflection and transfer.

### Previous (2026-01-02): Davidsonian Parsing
```
Davidsonian extraction: 80%+ coverage on common NL patterns ✓
Symbolic KB + forward chaining: Working ✓
Integration with differentiable logic: Completed ✓
```

**Innovation:** Rule injection - read text about reasoning → immediately apply knowledge

### Previous (2026-01-01): GA Validation
```
Neural Network (50 rules, 30 epochs):  0.00% accuracy ✗
Genetic Algorithm (30 generations):    61.6% fitness  ✓
TicTacToe GA (1 generation):           46.5% win rate ✓
```

**GA discovered interpretable rule:** `['NOUN', 'VERB']` pattern that matches all test examples!

## Why This Matters

### Hybrid Consolidation System (Current) 🚀
1. **Solves classical AI's fatal flaw:** Memory consolidation through neural learning (not fact accumulation)
2. **Keeps symbolic advantages:** Interpretable rules, fast inference, reflection capability
3. **Best of both worlds:** Neural generalization + Symbolic interpretability
4. **Unique to logic systems:** Can inject expert rules, extract patterns, transfer across domains
5. **Bounded memory:** Rules scale O(patterns), not O(examples)

**Key insight:** Use DLN for consolidation (like Transformers) but output logical forms (unlike LLMs). This enables reflection - the "secret sauce" for rapid learning.

### Davidsonian Approach (Foundation)
1. **Competitive advantage over LLMs:** Rule injection vs implicit weight learning
2. **Data efficiency:** Read once, apply forever (vs massive training data)
3. **Compositionality:** Events as first-class entities (unlimited modification)
4. **Interpretability:** Rules are inspectable and modifiable

### GA Validation (Foundation)
1. **Validates symbolic search:** Discrete optimization works for symbolic rules
2. **Sample efficient:** Found working rule with 7,500 evaluations (vs 30,000 for neural)
3. **Interpretable:** Can see exactly what pattern was learned
4. **Uses semantic-AR:** Fitness based on meaning preservation, not surface form

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Week)
1. ✅ Implement Davidsonian extraction
2. ✅ Create knowledge base with forward chaining
3. ✅ Integrate with differentiable logic network
4. ✅ Hybrid consolidation system working
5. 🔄 Scale up training on TinyStories

### Near-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Measure convergence improvement with rule injection
2. Add probabilistic/distributed outputs for exploration

### Research Questions
1. **Convergence:** Does rule injection meaningfully accelerate learning?
2. **Generalization:** Do consolidated rules transfer across domains?
3. **Scaling:** What happens with 100K+ examples?
4. **Reflection:** Can the system improve its own parsing rules?
